       <h2 class="subheader">About Me</h2>
       
       <p> My name is Daniel Bateman, Iâ€™m a 38 year old Graphic Artist, with educational aspirations of becoming a full stack developer. I have some introductory experience writing HTML and CSS, mainly through macOS, Adobe Dreamweaver, and professional experience using the full Adobe Creative Suite, CS6 and Creative Cloud. However, I do have advanced experience operating Microsoft Applications, including; the full Microsoft Office Suite.  </p>
           
       <p>Furthering my education to become professionallyy trained to use applications like GitHub, Brackets, Angular JavaScript, and Google Chrome Developer Tools is one of my current goals. I want to work with leading-edge technology to develop highly responsive iOT devices, by building i OT software or incorporating functions and properties from CSS and HTML into AI and other software. </p>

       <h3>Web Development</h3>

       <p> Some of my main interests are developing and renovating open source code using applications like Github. I am very excited about learning all the new features of html5, and how they can be used to give direction and understanding to web browsers and iOT devices with capabilities of processing large amounts of data and instructions. </p>

       <p> Finding a career in web development, associated with Search Engine Optimization or engineering would be a dream come true. I currently work at Dimitrious Jazz Alley, located in South Lake Union. I have worked there for about 1 year part time as an assistant property manager at the Jazz Alley Condominiums. I spend a lot of my free time designing websites and Illustrating images for all kinds of different projects. I hope to learn new techniques for developing websites and applications during my stay at Seattle Central College. </p>
