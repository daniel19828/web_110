       <h2 class="subheader">About Me</h2>
       
       <p> My name is Daniel Bateman, im a 38 year old graphic artist. I have some introductory experience writing html and css, mainly through Adobe Dreamweaver, which is a code writer and css designer. I am a Apple Mac OS X enthusist, however I do have experience operating Microsoft Windows and similar opporating systems. </p>
           
       <p>Continuing my education is importaint to me for a number of reasons, I want to work with leading-edge technology to develop highly resoponsive iOT devices that can be used to create a better way of life for all people to enjoy.. </p>

       <h3>Web Development</h3>

       <p> Some of my main interests are developing and renovating open source code using applications like Github. I am very excited about learning all the new features of html5, and how they can be used to give direction and understanding to web browsers and iOT devices with capabilities of processeing large amounts of data and instructions. </p>

       <p> Finding a career in web development, associated with Search Engine Optimization or enginering would be a dream come true. I currently work at Dimitrious Jazz Alley, located in South Lake Union. I have worked there for about 1 year part time as an assistant property manager at the Jazz Alley Condimnims. </p>
