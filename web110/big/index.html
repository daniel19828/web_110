  										<p>I will be designing and developing the wireframe of your website, :Pacific Northwest Gold Buyers of America” over the next several weeks. The more information you can provide me with pertaining to the specifics of your website the better. The conversations we have already had will be sufficient, however if you could jot down the name of two or three websites that you favor that would be great. I will be developing the framework of your site with HTML and the styles/colors with CSS.</p> 
  										<p>HTML/CSS is the most powerful combination of code todate. I will also be adding JAVASCRIPT to your website in order to control the behaviors and functions of your “Forms” and other elements of your site. Lastly, I will embed plenty of Metadata and Microdata into your site in order to optimize its placement on search engines like Yahoo and Google, along with other Social Media websites like Facebook and Twitter. If you have any questions please feel free to call or email at any time.</p>
